# Slime Combiner

This is a small program to show all of the renewable combinations of Slimes in Slime Rancher.

I wanted to find a way to calculate all of the easily-fed combinations of slimes.

Roostros are kind of a pain in the ass to go hunting for. I'd rather use the renewable fruits and veggies than Hen-Hens or Roostros.

This should also help when they release more Slimes; if all of the slimes have a renewable favorite food, then I can remove the coops to make more room.
